# The below configuration file is parsed using the libconfig library.
#
# Refer to the official documentation if you need it. Here is a quick breakdown
# of the syntax used.
#
# A value can be set using an equals sign or a colon, the trailing semicolon is optional
# and whitespace is not significant.
#
#   name = value;
#   name: value;
#
# { settings ... }  - curly braces denote a group of settings, and a group can contain
#                     multiple types of configuration
# [ value, ... ]    - square brackets denote an array, and all values within the array
#                     must be of the same configuration type
# ( value, ... )    - parentheses denote a list, and a list can contain multiple groups,
#                     arrays, scalar values or other lists
# /* */, // and #   - treated as comments
# @included "path"  - include another configuration file - useful if you want to split
#                     the configuration into smaller parts
#
# When it comes to syntax highlighting for these kind of configuration files you may
# try Ruby, awk, cucumber, perl, puppet or R.

#   grayscale                Can optionally take R, G and B coefficients
#                            to control luminance calculation. By default
#                            the Rec. 601 coefficients is used, i.e.
#                            (R × 0.299 + G × 0.587 + B × 0.114).

#                            (it could be a custom logo for example). The image is
#                            centered on the designated monitor, but if exact
#                            positioning is desirable then consider creating a
#                            transparent image the size of the screen and control
#                            the placement of the logo that way.

#   posterize                This filter reduces the number of colors in the image
#                            by specifying the number of levels of colors to keep.

#                            - affect the red channel (0 or 1)

#   posterize_bit_depth      This filter reduces the bit depth of an image.
#                            The first argument is a number between 1 and 16
#                            indicating how many bits to retain. The remaining
#                            three arguments are booleans indicating whether the
#                            red, green and blue channels are affected.
#                            - how many bits to retain (1 to 16) - lower numbers

#   random_blocks            Draws a block in a random place on the screen,
#                            intended to be used as an input feedback filter.
#                            The function takes up to eight arguments.

#                            - block width (default: image height / 16)
#                            - number of horizontal blocks (default depending
#                              on the aspect ratio of the image)

#                            - min position on the x-axis
#                            - max position on the x-axis

#                            - max position on the y-axis
#                            The last four arguments specify the min/max
#                            positions on the X-axis, and the min/max
#                            positions on the y-axis. This can be used to
#                            constrain the feedback to only affect a specific
#                            area. If not set these will be restricted to the

#                              < 1.0 decreases and > 1.0 increases saturation
#   scanlines                Adds scanlines:
#                            - spacing (pixels)
#                            - intensity (between 0.0 and 1.0), where lower
#                              numbers are more intense
#   screenshot               Takes a screenshot of the current desktop. Takes no
#                            arguments.
#   sobel                    Used for edge detection. Identifies object boundaries
#                            by calculating the gradient magnitude of pixel intensity
#                            changes. It uses two 3x3 convolution kernels to
#                            approximate the horizontal and vertical derivatives
#                            of an image, then combines these to highlight edges
#                            where intensity changes abruptly.
#                            Takes no arguments.
#   soft_noise               Generates softer noise.
#                            - amount > 0.0
#                            - strength between 0.0 and 1.0 and
#                            - an integer radius
#   solid_color              Paints the entire screen a solid color, like a
#                            standard slock would.
#                            - color to use (e.g. "FAILED", "INPUT", "INIT")
#   temperature              Adjusts the color balance to make the image colder
#                            or warmer. Takes one argument which is the
#                            temperature in kelvin.
#                            - kelvin (range 1000K to 40000K), where 2000 is very
#                              warm (orange), 6500 is neutral white (daylight),
#                              and 10000 is cool (giving a blue tint)
#                            - blend strength (0.0 to 1.0)
#   tint                     Blend each pixel with a given tint color.
#                            - red (0-255)
#                            - green (0-255)
#                            - blue (0-255)
#                            - blend strength (0.0 to 1.0)
#   vignette                 Adds a vignette around all monitors
#                            - overall strength (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.5),
#                              lower values meaning darker vignette
#                            - horizontal edge fraction (default 0.1)
#                            - vertical edge fraction (default 0.1)
#                            - corner radius (default 50)
#                            - smoothness exponent (default 2.0)
#   vhs_jitter               Simulates the VHS jitter effect.
#                            - max offset for the jitter
#   vhs_warp_chroma          Adds VHS distortion.
#                            - the height of the band to affect
#                            - the maximum shift
#                            - the minimum length of the distortion
#                            - boolean to indicate whether to affect the RGB
#                            channels independently (like chroma shift)
#   wallpaper                Uses an image as a wallpaper (base background).
#                            Takes one or more paths to image files to load, one
#                            for each monitor (ordered as per xrandr). The path can
#                            either be to an explicit file, or it can be a directory
#                            in which a random file will be chosen. Note that the
#                            wallpapers do not scale, but will center and crop if
#                            the wallpaper is too large. By default support for
#                            loading farbfeld (.ff) images is integrated, but if
#                            slock is compiled with imlib2 support then other file
#                            types can be loaded as well (e.g. .png, .jpg).
#                            - one or more paths to a file or directory
#                            - blend strength (0.0 to 1.0), optionally the wallpaper
#                              can be blended with the underlying image - this can
#                              be useful if you have a custom overlay
#   wave_distortion          Generates wave distortion.
#                            - max horizontal shift
#                            - wave frequency
#                            - phase offset
